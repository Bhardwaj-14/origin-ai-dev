Ionization: Xenon gas is ionized, creating positively charged ions.\n2. Acceleration: The ions are accelerated through an electric grid, gaining high velocity.\n3. Neutralization: Electrons are added to the ions to neutralize their charge, creating a high-velocity exhaust.\n4. Thrust: The exhaust is expelled, producing a continuous thrust.\n\nIonic thrusters are highly efficient, but produce low thrust, making them suitable for long-duration space missions, Sir."
